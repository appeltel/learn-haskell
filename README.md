# learn-haskell

Me learning Haskell. This project is an open learning exercise where
I make up my own tasks, read articles or books, and document what I
figure out.

## Resources being used

1. [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

## Unit 1: First steps

1. **DONE** Figure out how to memoize recursive functions, do the Fibonacci thing.

1. Take some text file, split it into "words", load it into a binary tree, and see and do stuff with that (TBD)
